# Digital-Filter-Design-using-Matlab
The objective of this project is to design a digital filter which can suppress the noise in ECG data  due to power line interference. 
As we know ECG data consists of different kinds of noises like electrode contact noise, instrumentation noise and electrosurgical noise etc. 
Our goal will be to minimize implementation cost and consider implementation using fixed precision algorithms.
One of the easiest and quickest methods for assessing the heart is an electrocardiogram, or ECG. We can determine the degree of physiological 
stimulation someone is feeling by using a technology that gathers electrical impulses produced by their heartbeat. However, many disturbances, 
including power line interference, electrode contact noise, instruments noise, electrosurgical noise, etc, frequently tamper with ECG data. 
The goal of this project is to create an appropriate filter in order to mitigate power line interference.
